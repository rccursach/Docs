# Introduction

Grafite CMS has a full scope theming tool built right in. You can easily generate basic themes that can be built on and kept clear of your views.
All the listed templates with a star are optional - otherwise everything else is required, for the basic support.

You have the ability to include other theme views into your view using the <code>&#64;theme('path')</code> directive with Blade. Otherwise its basically anything and everything Blade can do including any directives you wish to expand it with.
